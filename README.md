# Disease-Data-Management-and-Analysis
**Domain and Subdomain**: 
- **Domain**: Specific Disease Data Management and Analysis.
- **Subdomain**: Cardiovascular and Cancer Disease Tracking, focusing on heart valve disorders and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


**Key User Group**:
- The primary users of this application are **Cardiologists and Oncologists**. These specialists require a sophisticated tool to track disease progression, understand the effectiveness of various treatment plans, and make data-driven decisions for patient care.


**Users' Goals**:
- The primary goal for cardiologists and oncologists using this application is to **reliably track disease progression** and **correlate treatment plans with outcomes**. They aim to gain insights into the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for heart valve disorders and NSCLC and to use this data to guide future treatment decisions.


**Choice of Visualization and Its Effectiveness**:
- 'The visualization will utilise **heatmap interactive data visualization**, which is adept at representing complex datasets in an easily interpretable way. This type of visualization is particularly effective for our Cardiologists and Oncologists because:
   - It provides a **quick overview of large datasets**, helping specialists identify patterns and anomalies in patient responses to treatments.
   - Heatmaps can effectively represent **multiple variables** at once, which is crucial for understanding multifaceted diseases like heart valve disorders and NSCLC.
   - This method is **efficient in tracking progression over time**, allowing specialists to monitor changes and trends that could impact patient care.

**Additional Features and Their Utility**:
- Layered Information Display: The heatmap can provide different layers of information, such as demographic data, treatment types, and response rates. Users can toggle these layers to view specific aspects of the data, aiding in more targeted analysis.
- Interactive Data Points: Clicking on specific areas for example the patient name on the heatmap could provide detailed patient information, such as specific treatment regimens, progression metrics, and individual patient notes. This adds depth to the visualization, allowing for detailed case-by-case analysis.
- Colourization on the heatmap can help physicians tailor the visualization to their specific needs, making data interpretation more intuitive.
- Collaboration Tools: This feature will allow sharing visualizations with other specialists or medical teams. This will facilitate collaborative analysis and discussion.
- Download Feature: The download feature would allow users to download the data displayed in the heatmap, either in its visual form or as raw data. This can be in various formats such as PDF, PNG for images, or CSV, Excel for raw data. This is beneficial for the following reasons.
   - Patient Communication
   - Data Backup
   - Compliance and Legal Documentation
